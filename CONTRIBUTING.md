Contributing
============

Issues
======
Questions and Bugs can be submitted on the GitHub [issues page][1]. Before creating 
a new issue, please take a moment to search open and closed issues
and make sure a similar issue does not already exist. If one does exist, you
can comment on the existing issue to show your support for that issue.

Git Conventions
===============
Prior to contributing you will need to create a GitHub fork of the project that
you will be pushing your changes from.

Create a new branch in your fork with a name that describes the feature or bug
you'll be addressing.

Create a GitHub pull request early in the process so that the project maintainers
will be aware of your effort and able to coordinate your changes with current
development.
