    <template v-slot:aboveExplanation>
      <p>
        Snow-capped mountains, where snow accumulates all winter and often well into spring, function as <span class="emph">frozen water towers</span> by storing water as snow into late spring and summer<sup>1</sup>. When spring weather arrives, and the snow melts, the high elevation areas produce a large pulse of streamflow that redistributes water downstream through the landscape. These seasonal dynamics are critical components of the surface water cycle in the Western U.S., for both humans and <sup>2,3</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes in the <span class="emph">timing, magnitude</span> and <span class="emph">duration</span> of snowmelt may substantially alter downstream water availability<sup>2,4</sup>. 
        Approximately 2 billion people are expected to experience diminished water supplies because of seasonal snowpack decline this century<sup>5,6</sup>. Over the last half century, particularly in some regions of the Western U.S., annual snowpack levels have <span class="emph">declined</span><sup>7â€“9</sup> and contributed to <span class="emph">reduced of streamflow</span>, a trend supported by both models and on-the-ground observations<sup>2,4</sup>.
